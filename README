Specs
=====

You'll need to grab RSpec to run the specs: gem install rspec

Known Problems
==============

  * Dynect user must be able to login normally through UI
    * For example, a newly created user will be prompted to change password
      and hence cannot access the API until it is changed; this is currently
      not handled
